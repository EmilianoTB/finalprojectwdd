## Description

The project's goal is to create a weather webpage specifically for beach goers, with accurate weather
information and travel advisory details for various beach destinations. The goal is to help travelers plan
their beach trips effectively by providing comprehensive weather forecasts and relevant travel
advisories.

## Overview

Travelers frequently have difficulty locating reliable weather information tailored specifically to beach
destinations. While general weather forecasts are available, they may not be specific or applicable to
beach conditions. Travelers may also need additional information, such as travel advisories, to make
informed travel decisions.

## Audience

This project's target audience consists of beach goers looking for accurate weather forecasts and travel
advisories for their destinations. This could range from individuals planning a relaxing beach vacation
to professionals organizing beach events or excursions.
